README
To the Marker,

I've included screenshots from open refine in this archive, as they didn't seem to get included when I ran the makeDocx script. Also some of my charts seem to be in landscape in the word document, making them hard to read. However, viewed in the notebook both the open refine screenshots and the charts display correctly.

Many thanks,
Pablo
