Mr Gonzalez's request to have the details of his past deleted has led to a debate about the balance between the right to privacy and freedom of speech. Google has set up an expert committee to discuss how to deal with this thorny issue. Luciano Floridi, professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the Oxford Internet Institute in England discusses how the committee should find a solution.  \r\n\r\nHack in the Box\r\nSecurity experts and hackers converged on Amsterdam in the Netherlands this week for the Hack in the Box event. Reporter Jonathan Kent talks to Gareth Mitchell about the event and discusses recent security attacks, like that of eBay recently, in which millions of people have had their personal details compromised and also a bug called Heartbleed which compromised the SSL protocol for transmitting private information across the internet. \r\n\r\nMachine Translating Welsh \r\nThe Welsh Assembly has been working with Microsoft to use machine translation to produce official documents simultaneously in Welsh and English. It is keen to encourage the use of Welsh which is currently spoken by 20% of the population. Gareth meets the translation team in Cardiff. \r\n\r\n(Photo: A man surfs the internet \u00a9 AFP\/Getty)","media_type":"audio","medium_synopsis":"The Court of Justice of the European Union ruling on the 'right to be forgotten' online.
