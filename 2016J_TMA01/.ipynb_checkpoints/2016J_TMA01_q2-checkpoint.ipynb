However, I wondered if there might be other reasons as to why the parish wasn't populated. Perhaps some manhole covers didn't fall within a specific parish? Some quick research into parishes indeed reveal that some areas are 'unparished', which might explain some of these rows (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Devon). There may be other reasons for these rows - missing data for instance. But 328 rows out of 77,964 represents just 0.4% of the size of the dataset, and so the effect of removing them should be negligible on the final analysis.

For each school more than 1 building may be listed. For example, CLYST HYDON PRIMARY SCHOOL has 3 sites: MAIN SCHOOL SITE, DETACHED PLAYING FIELD and VILLAGE HALL SITE. Clearly we don't want to count individual buildings as this will distort the figures. In order to get a count of unique schools we will therefore have to group individual school buildings together. The postcode field seems like our best bet for doing this (the above 3 buildings all share the same postcode). If the postcode represents the school main site, rather than the postcode of the individual building, then this grouping will work. If on the other hand it represents the postcode of the building, then we have have an issue if some schools which had various buildings spread out geographically.
